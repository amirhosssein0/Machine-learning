🩺 Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

Python

License: MIT

A machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical data using various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
✨ Features

    Data Preprocessing: Clean, scale, and prepare data for model training.

    Multiple Models: Train and evaluate models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

    Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to measure model performance.

    Prediction: Classify an individual as diabetic or non-diabetic based on input features.

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

    Python 3.12+: Download Python

    Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for exploring the dataset interactively)

    Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains various medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and more. The goal is to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes.
Dataset Features:
Feature	Description
Pregnancies	Number of pregnancies
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness	Skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin	Insulin level (mu U/ml)
BMI	Body mass index (kg/m²)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction	Diabetes family history
Age	Age of the patient
Outcome	1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 if not
🛠 Technologies Used
